# Great developers write tests for their code. Whether through the practice of Test-Driven  # Development or not, it's important to be able to write tests that make sure your code behaves as # expected. It's also crucial to be able to read tests and understand the requirements they define # for your code. All of our tests go into the test/ or spec/ directory.
